Allows you to install one or more plugins simply by typing their names or download URLs in a textarea.

== Description ==

This plugin is an improvement to the current WordPress plugin installation methods. It allows you to install one or more plugins simply by typing their names or download URLs in a textarea.

All credit goes to **improvingtheweb**. This plugin is only a modification of **[Improved Plugin Installation](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/improved-plugin-installation/)**. The idea was to run the original plugin in the newer versions of WordPress. That's it. Also, we cut off the bookmarklet feature.

Thank you very much for the contributions: [drewapicture](http://profiles.wordpress.org/drewapicture/)

**Example**

The installation form will accept any of these inputs: 

* Contact Form 7
* http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/contact-form-7/
* http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/contact-form-7.3.3.2.zip

Plugins don't need to be hosted at wordpress.org. As long as you use the direct download URL, third party plugins will install without a problem.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin.
2. Unzip the plugin and upload the directory to `wp-content/plugins`.
3. Activate the plugin.
4. Go to "Plugins &raquo; Add new" to use.
